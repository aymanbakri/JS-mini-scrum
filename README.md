# mini scrum 


In this project "Scrum Board" there is three columns: "To do", "In progress" and "Done".

Each columns includes a task.

Stories are added by clicking on the plus sign (+) in the column header.

Stories can be sorted by dragging them up or down and can be dragged between columns.

Story has two icons on the right: edit and delete. Edit, opens the same dialog as
edit with the story's details filled. Delete pops a verification dialog.
